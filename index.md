## Machine Learning

### Large Language Models

**[Langchain Documentation Chatbot](https://github.com/erikgrip/langchain_docs_chatbot)**  
This project involves the development of a chatbot application capable of answering queries about the Python package Langchain. The application retrieves information about Langchain from a vector store loaded with markdown files from Langchain's Github repository.

**[Motion Title Generation](https://github.com/erikgrip/swedish_parliament_motion_summarization)**  
This project involves fine-tuning a language model to suggest titles for Swedish parliament motions. It also includes a simple web application to serve predictions. The project utilizes Python 3, Pytorch, and PyTorch Lightning. The training data is sourced from the Swedish Parliament's open data.

### Reinforcement Learning

**[Deep Q Model Playing Tic Tac Toe](https://erikgrip.github.io/tictactoe_reinforcement_learning/)**  
This project involves training a deep reinforcement learning model to devise a winning strategy for tic-tac-toe against an opponent making random moves. The project uses the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm and is implemented in Python with Keras and Tensorboard. It can be easily set up using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Supervised Learning

**[Blitz Chess Prediction](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_prediction/)**  
This project involves training a model to predict the outcomes of blitz chess games. The entire process, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the export of a fitted logistic regression classifier, is documented in a series of Jupyter Lab notebooks.
