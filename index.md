## Machine Learning and MLOps

### Supervised Learning

**[Motion Title Generation](https://github.com/erikgrip/swedish_parliament_motion_summarization)**  
This project involves fine-tuning a language model to suggest titles for Swedish parliament motions. It also includes a simple web application to serve predictions. The project utilizes Python 3, Pytorch, and PyTorch Lightning. The training data is sourced from the Swedish Parliament's open data.

**[Blitz Chess Prediction](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_prediction/)**  
This project involves training a model to predict the outcomes of blitz chess games. The entire process, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the export of a fitted logistic regression classifier, is documented in a series of Jupyter Lab notebooks.

### Reinforcement Learning

**[Deep Q Model Playing Tic Tac Toe](https://erikgrip.github.io/tictactoe_reinforcement_learning/)**  
This project involves training a deep reinforcement learning model to devise a winning strategy for tic-tac-toe against an opponent making random moves. The project uses the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm and is implemented in Python with Keras and Tensorboard. It can be easily set up using Docker and Docker Compose.

### MLOps

**[GCP Vertex AI online Feature Store](https://github.com/erikgrip/terraform-vertexai-feature-store/)**  
This project provides a simple and automated way to set up a feature store using Google Cloud's VertexAI and Terraform. A feature store is a critical component in the machine learning lifecycle, enabling consistent storage, management, and access to feature data for training and serving models. By using Terraform, we ensure that the infrastructure setup is reproducible and manageable as code.

## Chat Bots

**[Langchain Documentation Chatbot](https://github.com/erikgrip/langchain_docs_chatbot)**  
This project involves the development of a chatbot application capable of answering queries about the Python package Langchain. The application retrieves information about Langchain from a vector store loaded with markdown files from Langchain's Github repository.

## Data Visualization Projects

**[Chess Dashboard](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_dashboard/)**  
This project involves downloading a player's data from Chess.com and visualizing aggregated data in a Dash dashboard.
