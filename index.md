## Machine Learning

### Reinforcement Learning

[Deep Q Model Playing Tic Tac Toe](https://erikgrip.github.io/tictactoe_reinforcement_learning/)
This project trains a deep reinforcement learning model to find a winning tic-tac-toe strategy against an opponent playing random moves. The algorithm used is Deep Q Network (DQN). The project is implemented in Python with Keras and Tensorboard, and it can be easily set up using Docker and Docker Compose. An example model achieved 84% wins, 13% draws, and 5% losses over 1 000 evaluation games after 5 000 training games.

### Supervised Learning

[Motion Title Generation](https://github.com/erikgrip/swedish_parliament_motion_summarization)
This project fine-tunes a language model to suggest titles for Swedish parliament motions, and provides a simple web app to serve predictions. It is built using Python 3, Pytorch, PyTorch Lightning. The training data comes from the Swedish Parliament's open data.

[Blitz Chess Prediction](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_prediction/)
A project that trains a model for predicting chess games. The entire process, starting from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the export of a fitted logistic regression classifier, is documented in a series of Jupyter Lab notebooks. To explore the project, you can view the Jupyter notebooks in the /notebooks folder. However, to run the notebooks, you'll need Docker and Docker Compose.
