## Machine Learning

### Large Language Models

**[Langchain Documentation Chatbot](https://github.com/erikgrip/langchain_docs_chatbot)**  
This is a project to build a chatbot app, that can answer questions about the python package langchain. The app can search information about langchain from a vector store that is loaded with the markdown filea from langchain's Github repository.

**[Motion Title Generation](https://github.com/erikgrip/swedish_parliament_motion_summarization)**  
This project fine-tunes a language model to suggest titles for Swedish parliament motions, and provides a simple web app to serve predictions. It is built using Python 3, Pytorch, PyTorch Lightning. The training data comes from the Swedish Parliament's open data.

### Reinforcement Learning

**[Deep Q Model Playing Tic Tac Toe](https://erikgrip.github.io/tictactoe_reinforcement_learning/)**  
This project trains a deep reinforcement learning model to find a winning tic-tac-toe strategy against an opponent playing random moves. The algorithm used is Deep Q Network (DQN). The project is implemented in Python with Keras and Tensorboard, and it can be easily set up using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Supervised Learning

**[Blitz Chess Prediction](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_prediction/)**  
A project that trains a model for predicting chess games. The entire process, starting from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the export of a fitted logistic regression classifier, is documented in a series of Jupyter Lab notebooks. To explore the project, you can view the Jupyter notebooks in the /notebooks folder. However, to run the notebooks, you'll need Docker and Docker Compose.

## Data Visualisation

**[Chess Dashboard](https://erikgrip.github.io/chess_dashboard/)**  
Downloads a player's data from Chess.com and visualizes agregated data in a Dash dashboard.
